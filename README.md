# Algorithm-and-data-structure-1
This repository contains my codes from course Algorithm and Data Structure 1
i work learning some data structure using python, this are:
- Arrays
- Binary Trees
- Linked List

Also i learned algorithms to sort linked list and different types of queues:
- Priority Queue
- Queue(FIFO)
- Stack(LIFO)
- Sort(Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort and Merge Sort)

Finally i used Big O Notation to understand about time complexity of sorting algorithms.
